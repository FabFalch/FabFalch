# A bit about me!

ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm FabFalch!
 Currently diving into the exciting world of coding and loving it. Currently on a learning spree with languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. But I'm eager to expand my knowledge and skills in web development and beyond.

 Currently expanding my knowledge through Codeacademy and of course building my own projects.
